		[MOD-254][MOD-253] &quot;capture&quot; now accepts the &quot;keepOpen&quot; boolean key. Check out the example and documentation to find out more.
		[MOD-90] &quot;capture&quot; now accepts several new keys: overlay, which takes a view; and showRectangle, which takes a boolean.
		[MOD-223] Established parity between iOS and Android Barcode modules.
		- BREAKING CHANGE: iOS now uses event listeners instead of callbacks! Use Ti.Barcode.addEventListener(&#39;success&#39;, ...) instead of capture({ success: ...})!
		- BREAKING CHANGE: Android&#39;s contentType property is now an integer, instead of a string! Check out the example and documentation to find out more.
		- BREAKING CHANGE: All automatically parsed &quot;data&quot; keys will now be lower case. This ensures consistency across the API and ease of access. 
		- BREAKING CHANGE: Android now properly fires the &quot;cancel&quot; event, as documented. It was firing the &quot;canceled&quot; event.
		- Updated examples to be identical; only difference is iOS&#39;s example utilizes the allowRotation property.
		- Added support for processing &quot;WIFI&quot; QR Codes.
		- Android now supports the &quot;data&quot; property, offering up a easy to use dictionary of the properties from the scanned barcode.
		- Android now has a &quot;allowMenu&quot; property on the module. See the documentation to find out more.
		- Updated example to use &#39;var&#39; for module object returned from require.
		[MOD-293] Fixed issue with &#39;Cancel&#39; button not displaying on capture screen</p>
